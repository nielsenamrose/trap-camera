# Learning project 2: Trap camera
A new trap camera is only $99. The parts I will need to make my own will add up to a lot more than $99. So why?
This is a learning project. The purpose is to get hands-on experience with a set of tools that I will like to be proficient in.
* GIT and Github.
* Markdown
* Linux.
* Python.
* Open CV.
